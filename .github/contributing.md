Welcome to the BEE2.4 Default Pack issue tracker! Here are a few guidelines you should follow when posting an issue:

1. **Make sure you are opening your issue on the correct repository.** This repository is for issues related to the BEE2.4 resources like items and styles; anything related to the application itself goes on [BEE2.4](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/issues).
2. Before reporting a bug or suggesting a feature, **please search through the existing issues** to make sure nobody has already reported/suggested it. Duplicate issues are unnecessary and will immediately be closed, no matter how severe an issue it may be. Do not intentionally open a duplicate issue in an attempt to remind us about a bug/feature.
3. **Please provide as much information as possible when reporting bugs.** Tell us what pre-release version of BEE2.4 you are using, and what style you have selected. If something is broken in-game, include a screenshot, or even a GIF or video if necessary. If you're getting a compile error, turn on `developer 2` and post the console log. The more information you provide, the faster we'll be able to fix the bug.
4. **Please do not use the Issues page to ask questions.** This creates unnecessary issues which are only open for a brief period of time before being closed once the question is answered. If you have a question, first check the [FAQ](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/FAQ); if you can't find it there you can ask your question on our [Discord server](https://discord.me/beemod).
5. If you have multiple bug reports or feature requests which are not related to each other, **please create separate issues instead of combining them.** This allows us to individually label the issues, and close them once they are fixed/implemented. Combined issues will immediately be closed, no matter how elaborate the post may be.
6. And finally, **please keep in mind that BEEmod is not a wishlist for custom test elements/styles or specific items that only benefit the map you're working on now.** Suggesting a custom test element or style is fine, but please stick to things that other people have already implemented in a map or that you are willing to develop yourself. If you need a very specific item for a map you're working on, learn Hammer or find another way of doing it within the Puzzlemaker.
7. **Failure to follow these guidelines too many times may result in being BLOCKED from Bee2 Github Pages!**
